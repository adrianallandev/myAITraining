        "coreConcept": "AI enables machines to mimic human intelligence for tasks like decision-making, pattern recognition, and automation. Unlike traditional programming, which relies on explicit rules (e.g., if-then logic for network alerts), AI learns patterns from data to make dynamic predictions, such as detecting anomalies in server logs. Key areas include Machine Learning (ML) for predictive models, Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analyzing IT tickets, and Computer Vision for monitoring hardware via images. In IT, AI automates repetitive tasks (e.g., ticketing), enhances security (e.g., intrusion detection), and optimizes resources (e.g., server load balancing).",

AI types include: Narrow AI (task-specific, e.g., chatbots for IT ticketing or anomaly detectors for network security), General AI (theoretical, human-like intelligence for multi-task IT automation), Super AI (hypothetical, surpassing human capabilities, potentially revolutionizing IT infrastructure).
